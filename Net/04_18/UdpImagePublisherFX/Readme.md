# Udp Image Publisher and Subscriber Application

This is the start-up code of a few exercises. The exercises when completed
yield an application that consists of an "Image Publisher",  a Command Line
Interface application, and an "Image Subscriber", a Graphical User Interface
application. 

The subscriber sends a list of images whose paths are in a text file to a list
of groups whose corresponding multicast addresses are in another text file. In
addition, the name of the image list text file and that of the multicast
address text file are in a Java Properties file.
